        "I started playing": "I started playing LADS at the first half of ‘25 and finding how to build this or that character was hard especially since each of them have several playable companions and it is completely ungooglable! I have experience playing other games and there are always guides pages on tha topic! And i am still astonished that there are no fan page dedicated to LADS’s battle mechanics especially since it is a big part of the game.",
        "I cannot say": "I cannot say that i am an expert in the sphere but i wanna make a page there people (especially battle newbies) will be able to understand how to use companions they have in the easiest way possible. Since game description are extremely long and fan-made guides are hard to find (from my personal experience).",
        "At the moment":"At the moment I am planning on adding all the playable companions onto the page. Protocores have general descriptions and recommendations for each companion. No cards or any other non-battle related information are in the plans. For general game information you can check fandom wiki etc.",
